# Technology Stack

## Phaser
- Overview: Phaser is a fast, free, and open-source HTML5 game framework for creating 2D games for desktop and mobile web browsers.
- Features:
- Supports both Canvas and WebGL rendering,     ensuring broad compatibility.
- Rich plugin ecosystem and a large community, providing extensive resources and support.
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials to assist developers at all levels.
- Pros
- Easy to learn and use, making it ideal for beginners.
- Extensive feature set, including physics, input, and sound management.
- convert to javascript accessible
- I think it would be a great choice for creating simple, casual minigames in the Gaming Room in 2D.
- cons
- Limited support for 3D graphics and complex shaders, but then again we don't need that for this project.
- May not be suitable for large-scale projects with complex requirements.

Features:
- High-performance rendering with support for WebGL and Canvas fallback.
- Extensible architecture, allowing for the addition of custom features.
